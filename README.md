Deep Learning Made Easy with Keras (Thessaloniki Machine Learning Meetup)

To run the examples be sure to have all the required dependecies installed:
```
pip install tensorflow(-gpu)
pip install h5py scikit-learn matplotlib
pip install jupyter
```

If you want to use GPU acceleration use the following:
```
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
pip install h5py scikit-learn matplotlib
pip install jupyter
```


Then, clone the repository and start the jupyter notebook:
```
git clone https://github.com/passalis/keras_meetup
cd keras_meetup
python -m notebook
```
